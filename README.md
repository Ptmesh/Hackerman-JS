## Hackerman 

## Fun and interactive hacking simulation with a typewriter effect.

## Features

- User enters a username to begin the hacking simulation.
- Console-like interface with a typewriter effect displays step-by-step messages as if the user is "hacking" in real-time.
- Each message has a custom delay, giving the simulation a more realistic feel.
- Error handling ensures that the user is alerted if they do not provide a valid username.

## Concepts Learned

- Promises and `async/await` for handling asynchronous code.
- DOM manipulation to interact with HTML elements and update their content and styles.
- Timing functions (`setTimeout`) to introduce delays and create a typing effect.
- Error handling using try-catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions.
- Event listeners to respond to user interactions (e.g., clicking the "Start Hacking" button).

## Future Improvements

- Enhance UI with additional styling and animations.
- Expand the hacking simulation with more steps and challenges.
- Implement a back-end to simulate a real hacking experience.
